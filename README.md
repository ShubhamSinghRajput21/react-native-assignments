# Fetch Data assignment and manage your github repo

## Create a new Screen 

Add a button FETCH Data
On click present a loader and make an API call 
List the data on the same screen, existing button and loader should be removed
API Path : https://reqres.in/api/users

***Solution***
### I have created a file name FetchData.js in which i have a component FetchData which is doing all the work, I have imported this component directly in index.js file and passed it directly to appregistry.
